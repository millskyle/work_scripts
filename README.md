Bash/Python scripts and functions that I use on a daily basis.  Might be specific to my applications and documentation is likely to be poor.


I source sourceAll.sh from my .bashrc file on my computers which in turn sources all of the scripts that are activated (end in _a.sh)

> source sourceAll.sh
